### About Me

Hello, my name is Patrick Weatherford. I have been in Healthcare since 2010 but in 2017 I got into Healthcare Data & Analytics and I have been passionate about everything data since then. 

From 2017-2021 I self-taught myself many different reporting tools and skills related to Business Intelligence (ex. SQL, Tableau, SAP, etc.). In 2021 I felt like I had mastered the <i>descriptive</i> side of Data & Analytics and wanted to broaden my knowledge  so I decided to persue my Masters of Data Science (MSDS). From 2021-2023 I completed the program and learned many different modeling methods including probabilistic modeling, ensemble modeling, machine learning, and deep learning via neural networks. 

I am excited to see what the future holds for AI/Machine Learning and I proud to be in the field of Data & Analytics!
